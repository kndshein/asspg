  {
    question: 'Yes! Just tell me the damn joke before I click off the site!',
    answer:
      "OK, jeez. Who spiced your muffin today? Anyway, for context, a dictionary attack is a method of bypassing security by systematically using every word in a dictionary as the password. It is important to note that 'aardvark' is one of the first words in the dictionary, making it one of the first words being used in dictionary attacks. Therefore, it is funny that the whole website revolves around a very poor password choice. (You can laugh now.) Except, here's the kicker -- the \"password generator\" defaults to \"optimizing for reverse dictionary attacks\". That's funny because you are to assume that since dictionary attacks go through dictionary words in order from a to z, a reverse dictionary attack would iterate dictionary words from z to a, which makes a word like 'aardvark' that starts with an 'a' a \"good password\" since it would be used last. (You should be wheezing at this point.) With the mystery solved, you may now go ahead and explore the absolutely genius parody site for yourself.",
